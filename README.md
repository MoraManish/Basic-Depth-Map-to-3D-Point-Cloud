# Basic-Depth-Map-to-3D-Point-Cloud
This project converts depth maps into 3D point clouds using R. It processes depth images, extracts spatial information, and visualizes 3D structures using rgl. This method enables real-time 3D reconstruction for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.
